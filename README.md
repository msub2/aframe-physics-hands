This is a basic demo of velocity and acceleration-driven hands with PhysX + A-Frame. It follows mainly from [this tutorial](https://amebouslabs.com/developing-physics-based-vr-hands-in-unity/) by Amebous Labs, originally implemented in Unity. The velocity of the hands is driven by some simple vector math, while the acceleration is driven by a PD controller.
